Installing ``YT``
=================

``YT`` version 0.4 requires Julia version 0.5 or later, and may be installed just like any other Julia package:

.. code-block:: jlcon

    julia> Pkg.add("YT")

This will also install the following dependencies, if you don't have them installed already:

* `PyCall <http://github.com/stevengj/PyCall.jl>`_
* `PyPlot <http://github.com/stevengj/PyPlot.jl>`_
* `SymPy <http://github.com/jverzani/SymPy.jl>`_

However, for ``YT`` to work, ``yt`` itself must be installed. ``YT`` version 0.4
requires ``yt`` version 3.3.1 or higher. The best ways to install ``yt`` are via
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`_ or the `Anaconda Python Distribution <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_.

Once ``YT`` is installed, either

.. code-block:: jlcon

    julia> import YT

to use it as a library, or

.. code-block:: jlcon

    julia> using YT

to use it as an application, loading its methods into the current session's namespace.

Recommended Packages
--------------------

While not required, the following Julia packages are useful when working with data in ``YT``:

* `Winston <https://github.com/nolta/Winston.jl>`_ (a plotting package)
* `IJulia <https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl>`_ (Julia backend for IPython/Jupyter)
* `Glob <https://github.com/vtjnash/Glob.jl>`_ (find pathnames matching specified patterns, useful for constructing arrays of filenames)
